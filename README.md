# My Projects

I am currently working on several exciting projects, including a game, a website, and an app. These projects are built using various technologies such as Visual Studio Code, Pygame, PyOpenGL, Kivy, FastAPI, Panda, and pytest, as well as Machine Learning.

## Game Project

The game project consists of three sub-projects: an MMORPG, a survival horror game, and a puzzle arcade game. The game development is done using [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/), [PyOpenGL](http://pyopengl.sourceforge.net/), and [Panda3D](https://www.panda3d.org/).

### MMORPG

The MMORPG is an online multiplayer game with various features, including:

- Customizable characters
- Open-world exploration
- Quests and missions
- Player-vs-player combat

### Survival Horror

The survival horror game includes:

- Immersive storytelling
- Dynamic environments
- Challenging enemy AI
- Limited resources

### Puzzle Arcade

The puzzle arcade game features:

- Unique puzzles and challenges
- Time-based levels
- Leaderboards
- Unlockable rewards

## Website Project

The website project is called "Quiltastic" and specializes in quilting, bridal, and fashion. The website is built using [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) and [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/) for testing. Key features of the website include:

- Responsive design (underway)
- Product catalog (underway)
- Shopping cart and checkout (underway)
- User accounts and profiles (underway)

## App Project

The app project is a basic language learning and dating app, developed using the [Kivy](https://kivy.org/) framework. The app includes:

- Language learning modules
- Interactive quizzes
- Chat and messaging
- User profiles

[Download the App](website coming soon) (Under construction)


## Server Setup

I am also managing my own server to host the game, website, and app. The server provides the necessary resources to support the online components of the projects, such as the MMORPG and the language learning and dating app.

### Server Features

- High-performance hardware for optimal user experience
- Scalable architecture to handle increasing user traffic
- Security measures to protect user data and prevent unauthorized access
- Regular backups and maintenance to ensure server stability and uptime

### Technologies Used

The server is set up using various technologies and tools, including:

- [Linux](https://www.linux.org/) as the operating system
- [NGINX](https://www.nginx.com/) for web server and reverse proxy
- [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) for database management
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) for containerization and easy deployment
- [Certbot](https://certbot.eff.org/) for SSL certificate management and renewal
